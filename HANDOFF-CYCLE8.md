# Cycle 8 Handoff — Service Tickets

**Status:** Cycle 8 **IN PROGRESS** — Steps 1–7 (schemas + seed + ticket module + comments/activity/problems + notification consumers + helpdesk staff UI) **DONE**. Steps 8–10 remain. Cycles 0–7 are COMPLETE + APPROVED. Cycle 8 is the final cycle of Wave 1 and ships the M60 Service Tickets module — a shared reactive ticketing engine that IT, facilities, and HR support all use. NOT a facilities management system (that is M65, a future cycle). This module handles reactive requests like "my projector is broken," "Room 204 needs a new light bulb," "I can't log in." It integrates with Cycle 7's Task Worker (ticket assignment creates a task on the assignee's to-do list) and the Cycle 7 Approval Workflows engine (ticket escalation can route through an approval chain).

**Branch:** `main`
**Plan reference:** `docs/campusos-cycle8-implementation-plan.html`
**Vertical-slice deliverable:** Teacher submits a ticket "Projector not working in Room 101" under IT → Hardware → auto-assigned to the IT admin based on subcategory rules → SLA clock starts (4h response / 24h resolution for HIGH priority) → IT admin sees the ticket in their queue, adds an internal comment ("Ordered replacement lamp") → reassigns to facilities vendor → vendor reference recorded → admin resolves the ticket → requester gets a notification → ticket auto-closes after 48h if requester does not reopen → SLA metrics show response and resolution times on the admin dashboard.

This document tracks the Cycle 8 build at the same level of detail as `HANDOFF-CYCLE1.md` through `HANDOFF-CYCLE7.md`. It is the source of truth that external architecture reviewers read alongside `CLAUDE.md`. **A step is not complete until both files are current** (per the Operating Rules at the bottom of `CLAUDE.md`).

## What this cycle adds on top of Cycles 0–7

Cycle 8 is the third cross-cutting cycle of Phase 3 Wave 1. It is the operational counterpart to Cycle 7: where Cycle 7 gave every persona a unified Tasks app and a shared approval engine, Cycle 8 gives every staff persona a unified Helpdesk surface where the ticket lifecycle is the first-class object.

- **Tickets (M60).** The first reactive support engine in CampusOS. Every staff member submits problems through one inbox (`/helpdesk/new`) regardless of whether the problem is IT, facilities, or HR-support shaped. The category tree (configured per school) routes the ticket to the right queue and the right SLA policy. Auto-assignment runs at submission time using the same ROLE-resolution helper the Cycle 7 WorkflowEngineService uses for ROLE-typed approval steps. Internal comments stay invisible to requesters. Activity log is immutable. Vendors are first-class entities so a ticket can be escalated to an external party and the audit trail records it.
- **Cycle 7 integration.** A new auto-task rule on `tkt.ticket.assigned` (seeded in Step 3) feeds the existing Cycle 7 Task Worker. When a ticket is assigned, the worker creates a TODO task on the assignee's list ("Resolve ticket: …"). When the ticket is resolved, the service emits `tkt.ticket.resolved` and a downstream consumer marks the linked task DONE via `source_ref_id` matching. This is the first time Cycle 7's Task Worker is exercised by a non-trivial domain producer outside its seeded set; the wiring tests the worker's runtime add-rule path.
- **Cycle 5 + Cycle 4 integration.** Tickets carry a soft `location_id` ref to `sch_rooms` so "Room 101 projector" links to the scheduling room for context. Internal assignees reference `hr_employees(id)` as a DB-enforced FK; vendor assignees reference `tkt_vendors(id)`. A multi-column CHECK enforces that a ticket has at most one of the two — never both.

What does not change: every existing module continues to function. Cycle 8 is purely additive on the request path.

## Step 1 — Ticket Schema — Categories, SLA, Vendors

**Status:** DONE. Migration applied cleanly to `tenant_demo` and `tenant_test` on 2026-05-03. Idempotent re-provision verified (zero new applies on the second run; the IF NOT EXISTS guards on every CREATE TABLE / CREATE INDEX work as designed). Splitter-clean — Python audit script (block-comment + line-comment + single-quoted-string aware with `''` escape handling) confirmed zero `;` outside legitimate statement terminators on the first attempt. Third cycle in a row to clear the splitter trap on first try.

**Migration:** `packages/database/prisma/tenant/migrations/028_tkt_categories_sla_vendors.sql`.

**Tables (4):**

1. **`tkt_categories`** — Hierarchical ticket categories. `school_id`, `parent_category_id` self-FK (nullable for top-level rows), `name TEXT NOT NULL`, `icon TEXT` nullable, `is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true`. UNIQUE INDEX on `(school_id, name)` enforced across the full tree (a child cannot share a name with a sibling or top-level row in the same school). Partial INDEX on `(parent_category_id) WHERE parent_category_id IS NOT NULL` for child-tree traversal. Self-FK uses **NO ACTION** so an admin must move or deactivate child rows before deleting a parent — audit trail wins over cleanup ergonomics. Examples once seeded in Step 3: IT (parent) → Hardware, Software, Network, Account Access. Facilities (parent) → Electrical, Plumbing, HVAC, Cleaning, Furniture. HR Support (parent) → Payroll Question, Benefits Question.

2. **`tkt_subcategories`** — Leaf-level classification with optional auto-assignment hints. `category_id` FK → `tkt_categories(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` (subcategories die with their parent). `name TEXT NOT NULL`. `default_assignee_id` FK → `hr_employees(id) ON DELETE SET NULL` (when the seeded admin leaves the school, auto-assignment gracefully falls back to the role-based path or unassigned instead of breaking the rule). `auto_assign_to_role TEXT` nullable — a role token like `'SCHOOL_ADMIN'` resolved at submission time the same way the Cycle 7 WorkflowEngineService resolves a ROLE-typed approver. UNIQUE(category_id, name). When both `default_assignee_id` and `auto_assign_to_role` are NULL the ticket lands in the admin queue unassigned. Partial INDEX `(default_assignee_id) WHERE default_assignee_id IS NOT NULL` for the future "tickets I am the default assignee for" admin view.

3. **`tkt_sla_policies`** — Per-(school, category, priority) SLA target hours. `priority TEXT` 4-value CHECK `LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL`. `response_hours INT NOT NULL` with `> 0` CHECK; `resolution_hours INT NOT NULL` with `> 0` CHECK. **Multi-column `tkt_sla_policies_order_chk`** enforces `resolution_hours >= response_hours` so a misconfigured policy cannot ship where the ticket is breached on resolution before it can be breached on response. UNIQUE INDEX on `(school_id, category_id, priority)` so each (category, priority) pair has exactly one policy per school. INDEX on `(category_id)` for category-detail page reads. CASCADE on category delete (SLA rows are meaningless without their category). The Step 4 SlaService computes breach status from `tkt_tickets.created_at` and `now()` against this table — the clock is **not** stored as a countdown.

4. **`tkt_vendors`** — External vendor registry. `school_id`, `vendor_name TEXT NOT NULL`. `vendor_type TEXT` 9-value CHECK `IT_REPAIR / FACILITIES_MAINTENANCE / CLEANING / ELECTRICAL / PLUMBING / HVAC / SECURITY / GROUNDS / OTHER`. Contact fields (`contact_name`, `contact_email`, `contact_phone`, `website`) all nullable. `is_preferred BOOLEAN DEFAULT false` flags the vendor a school normally calls first; the Step 8 admin assignment dropdown sorts preferred vendors at the top. `notes TEXT`, `is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true`. UNIQUE INDEX on `(school_id, vendor_name)`. INDEX on `(school_id, is_active)` for the active-vendor list, plus a partial INDEX on `(school_id, is_preferred) WHERE is_preferred = true` for the "preferred-first" sort path.

**Soft cross-schema refs per ADR-001 / ADR-020:**

- `tkt_categories.school_id → platform.schools(id)`
- `tkt_sla_policies.school_id → platform.schools(id)`
- `tkt_vendors.school_id → platform.schools(id)`

(`tkt_subcategories` has no cross-schema soft refs; its `default_assignee_id` is a DB-enforced FK to the tenant table `hr_employees` and so is intra-tenant.)

**FK summary — 4 new intra-tenant DB-enforced FKs:**

- `tkt_categories.parent_category_id → tkt_categories(id)` **NO ACTION** (refuses delete with children)
- `tkt_subcategories.category_id → tkt_categories(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`
- `tkt_subcategories.default_assignee_id → hr_employees(id) ON DELETE SET NULL`
- `tkt_sla_policies.category_id → tkt_categories(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`

0 cross-schema FKs.

**Tenant logical base table count after Step 1:** 121 → **125**.

(Aside: the prior Cycle 7 narrative in `CLAUDE.md` reported "120 base tables after Cycle 7 Step 2," but the live database actually shows 121. The off-by-one drift originated when Cycle 6.1's `sis_student_demographics` table was double-counted in the cycle text: Cycle 6.1's own narrative says "tenant base table count: **107** after Step 2" while the Phase 2 polish callout says Phase 2 brought the count from 106 → 108, missing the 6.1 Step 2 +1 in the chain. Real chain: 106 (end of Cycle 6) → 107 (Cycle 6.1 Step 2 adds `sis_student_demographics`) → 108 (Phase 2 adds `sch_calendar_event_rsvps`) → 109 (Phase 2 adds `sis_child_link_requests`) → 115 (Cycle 7 Step 1 adds 6 tsk_\*) → 121 (Cycle 7 Step 2 adds 6 wsk_\*). The Cycle 8 handoff uses 121 as the pre-step baseline so the math closes against the live database. The CLAUDE.md update for Step 1 carries the corrected total forward.)

**Smoke results (live on `tenant_demo`, single BEGIN…ROLLBACK with savepoints, 15 assertions, 14 verified empirically + 1 verified via `pg_constraint` catalog inspection):**

1. **T1 happy path** — 5 inserts across all 4 tables succeed (1 top-level category + 1 child category + 1 subcategory linking to a real `hr_employees` id + 1 SLA policy + 1 preferred vendor).
2. **T2 vendor_type CHECK** — `tkt_vendors_type_chk` rejects `vendor_type='BOGUS'`.
3. **T3 priority CHECK** — `tkt_sla_policies_priority_chk` rejects `priority='MID'` (only LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL accepted).
4. **T4 response_chk** — `tkt_sla_policies_response_chk` rejects `response_hours=0`.
5. **T5 order_chk** — `tkt_sla_policies_order_chk` rejects `resolution_hours=4` when `response_hours=8` (resolution must be ≥ response).
6. **T6 categories UNIQUE** — `tkt_categories_school_name_uq` rejects a second row with the same `(school_id, name)`, even when `parent_category_id` differs (UNIQUE is across the full tree, not per parent).
7. **T7 subcategories UNIQUE** — `tkt_subcategories_category_name_uq` rejects a second leaf with the same `(category_id, name)`.
8. **T8 SLA UNIQUE** — `tkt_sla_policies_school_category_priority_uq` rejects a second policy on the same `(school, category, priority)`.
9. **T9 vendors UNIQUE** — `tkt_vendors_school_name_uq` rejects a second vendor with the same `(school, vendor_name)`.
10. **T10 parent NO ACTION** — DELETE on a top-level `tkt_categories` row with children is rejected by `tkt_categories_parent_category_id_fkey`.
11. **T11 bogus FK on subcategory.category_id** — INSERT with `category_id='00000000-…-0000'` rejected by `tkt_subcategories_category_id_fkey` (no matching row in `tkt_categories`).
12. **T12 bogus FK on default_assignee_id** — INSERT with phantom `hr_employees` UUID rejected by `tkt_subcategories_default_assignee_id_fkey`.
13. **T13 CASCADE on subcategory.category_id** — DELETE on the child category drops the linked subcategory; `count(*)` after delete is 0.
14. **T14 SET NULL on default_assignee_id when employee deleted** — verified via `pg_constraint` catalog inspection (`confdeltype='n'` on `tkt_subcategories_default_assignee_id_fkey`). Empirical destructive smoke against a temp `hr_employees` row was skipped because creating a temp employee requires a chain of `iam_person + platform_users` rows with their own NOT NULL constraints not directly relevant to this FK; the catalog readout is authoritative for FK action verification.
15. **T15 CASCADE on SLA policy when category dropped** — DELETE the parent category cascades through the child category → leaf subcategory and the SLA policy attached at the top level; `count(*)` of remaining SLA rows for the category id is 0.

**FK action verification via `pg_constraint`:**

```
tkt_categories_parent_category_id_fkey       NO ACTION
tkt_sla_policies_category_id_fkey            CASCADE
tkt_subcategories_category_id_fkey           CASCADE
tkt_subcategories_default_assignee_id_fkey   SET NULL
```

All 4 actions match the migration's declared intent.

**Sanity counts on `tenant_demo`:**

- 4 logical base tables under `tkt_*` (`information_schema.tables` filter on `tkt\_%` returns exactly 4 — none of these tables are partitioned, so the count matches the logical-table count directly).
- 4 `tkt_*` rows in `pg_constraint` for the new FKs (one per logical FK; no partition replication).
- 0 cross-schema FKs.

**Splitter audit:** Python state-machine audit (block-comment / line-comment / single-quoted-string aware) reports zero `;` inside any string literal or comment in the migration. Migration applied first try with no rewrite needed.

**What's deferred to later steps:**

- Step 2 lands `tkt_tickets` + `tkt_ticket_comments` + `tkt_ticket_attachments` + `tkt_ticket_tags` + `tkt_ticket_activity` (immutable audit) + `tkt_problems` + `tkt_problem_tickets`. The `tkt_tickets.subcategory_id` FK (added in Step 2) is **NO ACTION** so deactivating a subcategory does not orphan historical tickets — admins are expected to flip `is_active=false` rather than hard-delete leaves with ticket history.
- Step 3 seeds the category tree (IT / Facilities / HR Support, ~6 subcategories), the 12-row SLA matrix (3 categories × 4 priorities), and 2 vendors (preferred IT + facilities). Permission grants for `IT-001` + `FAC-001` (already in the catalogue at `permissions.json`) extend to Teacher / Staff (read+write) and School Admin / Platform Admin (admin via `everyFunction`). Cache rebuild runs after.
- Out of scope for the entire cycle (deferred per the plan): `tkt_ticket_asset_links` (requires M62 IT Infrastructure asset registry — future cycle), `tkt_vendor_updates` (requires `platform_vendor_accounts` vendor portal — future cycle), `tkt_knowledge_articles` (knowledge base — future polish), SLA breach cron worker (schema is ready, cron deferred to ops), ticket auto-close after 48h in RESOLVED state, email-to-ticket inbound, CSAT survey on ticket close.

## Step 2 — Ticket Schema — Tickets, Comments, Activity

**Status:** DONE. Migration applied cleanly to `tenant_demo` and `tenant_test` on 2026-05-03. Idempotent re-provision verified (zero new applies on the second run; the IF NOT EXISTS guards on every CREATE TABLE / CREATE INDEX work as designed). Splitter-clean — Python state-machine audit (block-comment / line-comment / single-quoted-string aware with `''` escape handling) confirmed zero `;` outside legitimate statement terminators on the first attempt. Fourth migration in a row to clear the splitter trap on first try.

**Migration:** `packages/database/prisma/tenant/migrations/029_tkt_tickets_and_activity.sql`.

**Tables (7):**

1. **`tkt_tickets`** — One row per support ticket. `school_id`, `category_id` (NOT NULL FK), `subcategory_id` (nullable FK), `requester_id` (NOT NULL soft ref to `platform.platform_users`), `assignee_id` (nullable FK to `hr_employees`), `vendor_id` (nullable FK to `tkt_vendors`), `vendor_reference` (nullable; nullable even when vendor_id is set because some vendors do not issue a WO/case number), `vendor_assigned_at` TIMESTAMPTZ, `title TEXT NOT NULL`, `description`, `priority TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'MEDIUM'` 4-value CHECK `LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL`, `status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'OPEN'` 7-value CHECK `OPEN / IN_PROGRESS / VENDOR_ASSIGNED / PENDING_REQUESTER / RESOLVED / CLOSED / CANCELLED`, `sla_policy_id` (nullable FK to `tkt_sla_policies`), `location_id` (soft ref to `sch_rooms` — kept soft so the ticket survives a room being retired in Cycle 5 scheduling), `first_response_at`, `resolved_at`, `closed_at`. Three multi-column CHECKs:
   - **`tkt_tickets_assignee_or_vendor_chk`** — `(assignee_id IS NULL OR vendor_id IS NULL)` — a ticket is assigned to either an internal employee or an external vendor, never both.
   - **`tkt_tickets_vendor_pair_chk`** — `vendor_id` and `vendor_assigned_at` must be all-set or all-null together; a stray timestamp without a vendor cannot ship.
   - **`tkt_tickets_resolved_chk`** — keeps `resolved_at` and `closed_at` in lockstep with status across the four lifecycle phases: working states (OPEN / IN_PROGRESS / VENDOR_ASSIGNED / PENDING_REQUESTER) ⇒ both NULL; RESOLVED ⇒ resolved_at NOT NULL, closed_at NULL; CLOSED ⇒ both NOT NULL (close requires prior resolve); CANCELLED ⇒ resolved_at NULL, closed_at NOT NULL (cancellation ends the lifecycle without resolution).

   Four indexes: `(school_id, status, created_at DESC)` for the admin queue hot path; partial `(assignee_id, status) WHERE assignee_id IS NOT NULL` for "tickets assigned to me"; partial `(vendor_id, status) WHERE vendor_id IS NOT NULL` for the vendor-side queue; `(requester_id, created_at DESC)` for "my submitted tickets".

2. **`tkt_ticket_comments`** — Append-only thread on a ticket. `ticket_id` FK CASCADE; `author_id` (soft ref to `platform.platform_users`); `body TEXT NOT NULL`; `is_internal BOOLEAN DEFAULT false` distinguishes staff-only notes from comments the requester sees. INDEX `(ticket_id, created_at)` for chronological thread render.

3. **`tkt_ticket_attachments`** — Signed-S3-URL pattern matching `hr_employee_documents` from Cycle 4. `ticket_id` FK CASCADE, `s3_key TEXT NOT NULL`, `filename`, `content_type`, `file_size_bytes BIGINT` with a non-negative CHECK, `uploaded_by` (soft ref). INDEX `(ticket_id, uploaded_at)`.

4. **`tkt_ticket_tags`** — Free-form admin tags. `ticket_id` FK CASCADE, `tag TEXT NOT NULL`. UNIQUE INDEX `(ticket_id, tag)` so a single tag cannot land twice on the same ticket. Secondary INDEX `(tag)` for cross-ticket "show me everything tagged X" filter.

5. **`tkt_ticket_activity`** — IMMUTABLE audit log per ADR-010 (service-side discipline — no DB trigger so emergency operator action remains possible). `ticket_id` FK CASCADE, `actor_id` UUID nullable (so system-driven entries like `SLA_BREACH` from a future cron worker can land without an actor), `activity_type TEXT NOT NULL` 7-value CHECK `STATUS_CHANGE / REASSIGNMENT / COMMENT / ATTACHMENT / ESCALATION / VENDOR_ASSIGNMENT / SLA_BREACH`, `metadata JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb`. INDEX `(ticket_id, created_at)`. Metadata convention documented in COMMENT: STATUS_CHANGE rows carry `{from, to}`; REASSIGNMENT rows carry `{from_assignee_id, to_assignee_id}`; VENDOR_ASSIGNMENT rows carry `{vendor_id, vendor_reference}`; SLA_BREACH rows carry `{breach_type, hours_overdue}`.

6. **`tkt_problems`** — Root-cause grouping for related tickets. `school_id`, `title TEXT NOT NULL`, `description TEXT NOT NULL` (description is required because a problem without a description is just a tag), `category_id` (NOT NULL FK NO ACTION), `status TEXT DEFAULT 'OPEN'` 4-value CHECK `OPEN / INVESTIGATING / KNOWN_ERROR / RESOLVED`, `root_cause`, `resolution`, `workaround`, `assigned_to_id` (nullable FK to `hr_employees` SET NULL), `vendor_id` (nullable FK to `tkt_vendors` SET NULL), `created_by` (NOT NULL soft ref), `resolved_at`. Two multi-column CHECKs:
   - **`tkt_problems_assigned_or_vendor_chk`** — mirrors the ticket-level mutex (`assigned_to_id` XOR `vendor_id`).
   - **`tkt_problems_resolved_chk`** — OPEN / INVESTIGATING ⇒ `resolved_at` NULL; KNOWN_ERROR ⇒ `root_cause IS NOT NULL` AND `resolved_at` NULL (a known-error must have a documented cause but is not yet resolved); RESOLVED ⇒ `root_cause`, `resolution`, `resolved_at` all NOT NULL.

   Two indexes: `(school_id, status)` for the problem list, `(category_id)` for category-detail lookups.

7. **`tkt_problem_tickets`** — Many-to-many link between `tkt_problems` and `tkt_tickets`. `problem_id` FK CASCADE + `ticket_id` FK CASCADE (double-CASCADE since the link row has no meaning without either side). UNIQUE INDEX `(problem_id, ticket_id)` so a ticket cannot be linked twice to the same problem. Secondary INDEX `(ticket_id)` so the ticket detail page can quickly find any problems this ticket is part of.

**Soft cross-schema refs per ADR-001 / ADR-020:**

- `tkt_tickets.requester_id → platform.platform_users(id)`
- `tkt_tickets.location_id → sch_rooms(id)` (intra-tenant but kept soft)
- `tkt_ticket_comments.author_id → platform.platform_users(id)`
- `tkt_ticket_attachments.uploaded_by → platform.platform_users(id)`
- `tkt_ticket_activity.actor_id → platform.platform_users(id)` (nullable — system rows allowed)
- `tkt_problems.created_by → platform.platform_users(id)`

**FK summary — 14 new intra-tenant DB-enforced FKs:**

| FK                                              | Action      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `tkt_tickets.category_id → tkt_categories(id)`        | NO ACTION   |
| `tkt_tickets.subcategory_id → tkt_subcategories(id)`  | NO ACTION   |
| `tkt_tickets.assignee_id → hr_employees(id)`          | SET NULL    |
| `tkt_tickets.vendor_id → tkt_vendors(id)`             | SET NULL    |
| `tkt_tickets.sla_policy_id → tkt_sla_policies(id)`    | SET NULL    |
| `tkt_ticket_comments.ticket_id → tkt_tickets(id)`     | CASCADE     |
| `tkt_ticket_attachments.ticket_id → tkt_tickets(id)`  | CASCADE     |
| `tkt_ticket_tags.ticket_id → tkt_tickets(id)`         | CASCADE     |
| `tkt_ticket_activity.ticket_id → tkt_tickets(id)`     | CASCADE     |
| `tkt_problems.category_id → tkt_categories(id)`       | NO ACTION   |
| `tkt_problems.assigned_to_id → hr_employees(id)`      | SET NULL    |
| `tkt_problems.vendor_id → tkt_vendors(id)`            | SET NULL    |
| `tkt_problem_tickets.problem_id → tkt_problems(id)`   | CASCADE     |
| `tkt_problem_tickets.ticket_id → tkt_tickets(id)`     | CASCADE     |

All 14 actions confirmed via `pg_constraint.confdeltype` catalog readout. 0 cross-schema FKs.

**Tenant logical base table count after Step 2: 125 → 132** (+7 logical `tkt_*` tables, none partitioned). Cycle 8 running total so far: 11 `tkt_*` tables (4 from Step 1 + 7 from Step 2).

**Smoke results (live on `tenant_demo`, single BEGIN…ROLLBACK with savepoints, 29 assertions, all green):**

1. **T1** — happy-path OPEN ticket inserts cleanly with `category_id`, `subcategory_id`, `requester_id`, `priority='HIGH'`, `status='OPEN'`, `sla_policy_id`.
2. **T2** — `tkt_tickets_status_chk` rejects `status='BOGUS'`.
3. **T3** — `tkt_tickets_priority_chk` rejects `priority='MID'`.
4. **T4** — `tkt_tickets_assignee_or_vendor_chk` rejects a row with both `assignee_id` AND `vendor_id` set. (Note: `tkt_tickets_resolved_chk` would also fire on the same row if it were structured differently; in this test the assignee_or_vendor_chk fires first as documented in the smoke output.)
5. **T5** — `tkt_tickets_vendor_pair_chk` rejects `vendor_id` set without `vendor_assigned_at`.
6. **T6** — `tkt_tickets_vendor_pair_chk` rejects `vendor_assigned_at` set without `vendor_id`.
7. **T7** — `tkt_tickets_resolved_chk` rejects status=OPEN with `resolved_at` set.
8. **T8** — `tkt_tickets_resolved_chk` rejects status=RESOLVED without `resolved_at`.
9. **T9** — `tkt_tickets_resolved_chk` rejects status=CLOSED without `closed_at`.
10. **T10** — `tkt_tickets_resolved_chk` rejects status=CANCELLED with `resolved_at` set (CANCELLED ends without resolution).
11. **T11** — Lifecycle round-trip OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → RESOLVED → CLOSED. Final state: `status='CLOSED'`, `has_resolved=t`, `has_closed=t`. The `resolved_chk` allows the timestamps to land in the same UPDATE statement as the status flip.
12. **T12** — Direct insert of a VENDOR_ASSIGNED ticket with `vendor_id` + `vendor_reference='WO-2026-0001'` + `vendor_assigned_at=now()` and no internal assignee succeeds.
13. **T13** — comment + activity inserts succeed against the active ticket: 2 comments (one public, one internal), 2 activity rows (one STATUS_CHANGE with metadata `{from, to}`, one SLA_BREACH with metadata `{breach_type, hours_overdue}` and `actor_id` NULL — system-row pattern).
14. **T14** — `tkt_ticket_activity_type_chk` rejects `activity_type='BOGUS'`.
15. **T15** — `tkt_ticket_tags_ticket_tag_uq` rejects a duplicate `(ticket_id, tag)` pair.
16. **T16** — `tkt_ticket_attachments_size_chk` rejects `file_size_bytes=-1`.
17. **T17** — NO ACTION on `tkt_subcategories` delete with referencing ticket. `tkt_tickets_subcategory_id_fkey` fires correctly.
18. **T18** — Top-level category NO ACTION verification chained through subcategory cleanup; the subcategory NO ACTION fires first (as expected — the test pre-deletes the subcategory rows and the ticket's subcategory_id FK rejects). The catalog confirms `tkt_tickets.category_id` is also NO ACTION; an empirical version of the category-only test would require deleting all referencing tickets first, which this smoke does not do.
19. **T19** — CASCADE on ticket delete drops 2 comments + 2 activity rows + 1 tag in one statement; counts go from `(2, 2, 1)` to `(0, 0, 0)`.
20. **T20** — `tkt_problems_resolved_chk` rejects `status='BOGUS'` (the resolved_chk OR-clause fires first — BOGUS does not match any of the 4 status branches in the multi-column predicate, same row-rejection as if `tkt_problems_status_chk` had fired; both constraints catch the bogus value).
21. **T21** — `tkt_problems_assigned_or_vendor_chk` rejects a row with both `assigned_to_id` and `vendor_id` set.
22. **T22** — `tkt_problems_resolved_chk` rejects KNOWN_ERROR without `root_cause`.
23. **T23** — `tkt_problems_resolved_chk` rejects RESOLVED with `root_cause` set but `resolution` missing.
24. **T24** — Happy-path: 1 problem in INVESTIGATING status + 2 link rows linking to two existing tickets succeed.
25. **T25** — `tkt_problem_tickets_pair_uq` rejects a duplicate `(problem_id, ticket_id)` pair.
26. **T26** — CASCADE on problem delete drops the 2 link rows (count goes 2 → 0).
27. **T27** — CASCADE on ticket delete drops the link row from the ticket side (count for ticket-1 goes 1 → 0).
28. **T28** — Bogus FK on `tkt_tickets.category_id` (UUID `00000000-…-0000`) rejected by `tkt_tickets_category_id_fkey`.
29. **T29** — Bogus FK on `tkt_ticket_comments.ticket_id` rejected by `tkt_ticket_comments_ticket_id_fkey`.

**FK action verification via `pg_constraint`:** All 14 `tkt_*` FKs in the migration round-trip through the catalog with the correct `confdeltype` value (NO ACTION 'a' / CASCADE 'c' / SET NULL 'n'). Output captured in the smoke transcript.

**Sanity counts on `tenant_demo`:**

- 11 logical `tkt_*` base tables (4 from Step 1 + 7 from Step 2).
- 14 rows in `pg_constraint` for the new FKs (one per logical FK; no partition replication since none of these tables are partitioned).
- 0 cross-schema FKs.
- Idempotent re-provision is a clean no-op on the SQL.

**Splitter audit:** Python state-machine audit reports zero `;` inside any string literal or comment. Migration applied first try with no rewrite needed.

**Constraint observation worth carrying forward:** When a multi-column CHECK is structured as a multi-branch OR (the resolved_chk pattern from Cycles 5–7 + this Step), Postgres evaluates the whole OR clause and reports the first CHECK whose name appears in the catalog ordering as the failing constraint. This means `tkt_problems_resolved_chk` is sometimes reported as the failing constraint when the actual issue is a `status_chk`-shaped violation — the OR clause's status-list filter rejects BOGUS before the standalone `status_chk` gets a chance. Same row-rejection outcome; the constraint name in the error message is just the first one to fire in the evaluation order. Cycle 5 documented this same observation for `sch_coverage_requests.assignment_chk` vs `status_chk`.

**What's deferred to later steps:**

- Step 3 seeds the category tree (6 categories + 9 subcategories), 12-row SLA matrix (3 categories × 4 priorities), 2 vendors, 5 sample tickets across the 5 status states, 3 sample comments (1 public + 1 internal + 1 resolution), 8 activity rows, 1 sample problem linking 2 tickets, 1 auto-task rule on `tkt.ticket.assigned`, plus permission grants for `IT-001` + `FAC-001`.
- Step 4 lands the request-path TicketService / CategoryService / SlaService / VendorService with ~18 endpoints. The service layer enforces the ticket auto-assignment chain (subcategory `default_assignee_id` → `auto_assign_to_role` → unassigned), records `first_response_at` on the first staff comment, and emits `tkt.ticket.{submitted,assigned,resolved}`.
- Step 5 lands CommentService / ActivityService / ProblemService — the activity log is written by a private `recordActivity()` helper called from every lifecycle path. The smoke verified that the audit table accepts every activity_type value and that CASCADE on the parent ticket drops the audit rows; the IMMUTABLE-by-discipline rule lives in the service code.

## Step 3 — Seed Data — Categories, SLA, Vendors, Sample Tickets

**Status:** DONE. New `packages/database/src/seed-tickets.ts` (idempotent, gated on `tkt_categories` row count for the demo school). `seed:tickets` script wired into `package.json`. `seed-iam.ts` updated to grant `IT-001:read+write` to Teacher and Staff. `iam_effective_access_cache` rebuilt: Teacher 38 → 40, Staff 18 → 20 (each gained 2 perms). All other personas unchanged.

**Permission grants:**

| Persona  | Perms before | Perms after | Delta              |
| -------- | -----------: | ----------: | ------------------ |
| Teacher  |           38 |          40 | +`IT-001:read+write` |
| Staff    |           18 |          20 | +`IT-001:read+write` |

School Admin and Platform Admin already hold `IT-001:admin` and `FAC-001:admin` via the `everyFunction: ['read','write','admin']` catalogue grant — no change needed there. Catalogue total stays at **447 functions × 3 tiers = 1341 permission codes** (no new entries; `IT-001` "Helpdesk Tickets" + `FAC-001` "Maintenance Tickets" are already in `permissions.json` from earlier cycles waiting for Cycle 8). Per the plan, FAC-001 read/write is **not** extended to non-admin staff — `IT-001` is the umbrella code the Step 4 TicketService will gate on for all ticket categories. School-side ticket admin paths (queue management, category tree editing, vendor management) reach `FAC-001:admin` via the `everyFunction` mechanism.

**What's seeded on `tenant_demo` (test tenant stays empty by convention — matches prior seeds):**

1. **3 top-level `tkt_categories`** — IT (icon=`computer`), Facilities (icon=`wrench`), HR Support (icon=`people`). All `is_active=true`. No nested categories this cycle; the hierarchy lives in `tkt_subcategories`.

2. **11 `tkt_subcategories`:**

   | Parent       | Subcategory       | default_assignee_id | auto_assign_to_role |
   | ------------ | ----------------- | -------------------: | ------------------: |
   | IT           | Hardware          | Sarah Mitchell (principal) | —                   |
   | IT           | Software          | —                    | —                   |
   | IT           | Network           | —                    | —                   |
   | IT           | Account Access    | —                    | —                   |
   | Facilities   | Electrical        | —                    | `SCHOOL_ADMIN`      |
   | Facilities   | Plumbing          | —                    | —                   |
   | Facilities   | HVAC              | —                    | —                   |
   | Facilities   | Cleaning          | —                    | —                   |
   | Facilities   | Furniture         | —                    | —                   |
   | HR Support   | Payroll Question  | —                    | —                   |
   | HR Support   | Benefits Question | —                    | —                   |

   IT/Hardware exercises the direct-assignee path; Facilities/Electrical exercises the role-resolution path. The other 9 leaves land tickets in the admin queue unassigned — the Step 4 TicketService will provide the default behaviour. Sarah Mitchell stands in as the IT admin for the demo since the `admin@` Platform Admin persona is intentionally NOT bridged to `hr_employees` per the Cycle 4 Step 0 design.

3. **12 SLA policies** — 3 categories × 4 priorities, identical shape across all 3 categories:

   | Priority  | response_hours | resolution_hours |
   | --------- | -------------: | ---------------: |
   | CRITICAL  |              1 |                4 |
   | HIGH      |              2 |                8 |
   | MEDIUM    |              4 |               24 |
   | LOW       |              8 |               72 |

   Live verification: `SELECT priority, response_hours, resolution_hours, c.name FROM tkt_sla_policies sla JOIN tkt_categories c ON c.id = sla.category_id` returned all 12 rows in the expected shape. In production each school would tune these per category; the demo uses one matrix.

4. **2 vendors:**
   - **Springfield IT Solutions** (`vendor_type=IT_REPAIR`, `is_preferred=true`, contact Patricia Nguyen `support@springfield-it.example` `+1-217-555-0420` `https://springfield-it.example`).
   - **Lincoln Maintenance Co** (`vendor_type=FACILITIES_MAINTENANCE`, `is_preferred=false`, contact Greg Owens `dispatch@lincoln-maintenance.example` `+1-217-555-0451` `https://lincoln-maintenance.example`).

5. **5 sample tickets** covering 5 of the 7 lifecycle states (PENDING_REQUESTER and CANCELLED are deliberately omitted — they require the Step 4 TicketService to drive transitions in production):

   | # | Title                              | Category          | Priority  | Status            | Assignee           |
   | - | ---------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
   | 1 | Projector not working in Room 101  | IT/Hardware       | HIGH      | OPEN              | Sarah Mitchell     |
   | 2 | Leaking faucet in staff bathroom   | Facilities/Plumbing | MEDIUM  | IN_PROGRESS       | Sarah Mitchell     |
   | 3 | Can't access gradebook             | IT/Software       | HIGH      | RESOLVED          | Sarah Mitchell     |
   | 4 | Light out in hallway B             | Facilities/Electrical | LOW   | VENDOR_ASSIGNED   | Lincoln Maintenance Co |
   | 5 | Payroll date question              | HR Support/Payroll | LOW      | CLOSED            | Sarah Mitchell     |

   Requesters span Rivera (T1, T3, T5), Park (T2), and Hayes (T4) so the demo exercises the row-scope filter the Step 4 service will apply. Every ticket has its `sla_policy_id` populated so the SLA breach computation has a target. T2 has `first_response_at` populated; T3 and T5 have `first_response_at` + `resolved_at`; T4 has `first_response_at` + `vendor_assigned_at` + `vendor_reference='WO-2026-0451'`; T5 has `first_response_at` + `resolved_at` + `closed_at` populated end-to-end (passes the `resolved_chk` lifecycle invariant).

6. **3 sample comments:**
   - **T1 public:** "It started failing during 3rd period yesterday. The bulb still lights but no image on either input." — from Rivera, the requester.
   - **T2 internal:** "Need to order a P-trap replacement. Logged with maintenance for Friday." — from Mitchell. `is_internal=true`; the requester (Park) will not see this when the Step 4 CommentService filters comment lists for non-staff readers.
   - **T3 resolution:** "Cleared the cache and reset the gradebook permissions. Please confirm you can access again." — from Mitchell. Public, lands in T3's thread along with the RESOLVED status flip.

7. **8 activity rows** tracing lifecycle transitions across the 5 tickets:

   | Ticket | activity_type     | metadata                              | actor          |
   | ------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
   | T1     | COMMENT           | `{is_internal:false}`                 | Rivera         |
   | T2     | STATUS_CHANGE     | `{from:OPEN, to:IN_PROGRESS}`         | Mitchell       |
   | T2     | COMMENT           | `{is_internal:true}`                  | Mitchell       |
   | T3     | STATUS_CHANGE     | `{from:OPEN, to:RESOLVED}`            | Mitchell       |
   | T3     | COMMENT           | `{is_internal:false}`                 | Mitchell       |
   | T4     | VENDOR_ASSIGNMENT | `{vendor_id, vendor_reference}`       | Mitchell       |
   | T4     | REASSIGNMENT      | `{from_assignee_id:null, to_vendor_id}` | Mitchell     |
   | T5     | STATUS_CHANGE     | `{from:OPEN, to:CLOSED}`              | Mitchell       |

   Total = 8 — matches the plan. T5's STATUS_CHANGE is a single roll-up entry (OPEN → CLOSED) rather than three discrete transitions because the historical seed represents a closed-out audit row; the Step 4 service in production will write 3 rows (OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → RESOLVED → CLOSED) as the lifecycle plays out.

8. **1 problem with 2 link rows** — "Network switch failure in Building A" — `status=INVESTIGATING`, `category_id=IT`, `assigned_to_id=Sarah Mitchell`, `created_by=principal@`. Linked to T1 (Projector) and T3 (Gradebook access). This is an architectural problem of the kind the Step 5 ProblemService.resolve admin endpoint will batch-resolve: documenting the root cause once and flipping every linked OPEN/IN_PROGRESS ticket to RESOLVED in one transaction. The seed leaves the problem in INVESTIGATING so the Step 9 UI has an in-flight row to render.

9. **1 auto-task rule** on `tkt.ticket.assigned`:
   - `priority='HIGH'`, `task_category='ADMINISTRATIVE'`, `due_offset_hours=24`, `is_system=true`, `is_active=true`.
   - `target_role=NULL` so the Step 4 Cycle 7 TaskWorker uses its `payload.recipientAccountId / accountId` fallback. The Step 4 TicketService will need to map the assignee's `hr_employees.id` to `platform_users.id` before emitting (similar to the AbsenceRequestNotificationConsumer's school-admin lookup pattern); the seed leaves the rule in place so the Step 4 implementation has a target rule to wire.
   - 1 `tsk_auto_task_actions` row: `action_type='CREATE_TASK'`, `sort_order=0`, empty `action_config`.
   - Title template: `Resolve ticket: {ticket_title}` — Worker's `template-render.ts` substitutes `{ticket_title}` from the event payload.
   - Description template: `SLA: {resolution_hours}h. Priority: {priority}.`

   Plan-time clarification: the plan says "due_offset = resolution_hours from the SLA policy." The seed sets a fixed 24h offset (matching the MEDIUM priority default) because `due_offset_hours` is a constant on the rule row, not a per-ticket lookup; the Step 4 service can override the offset by passing `dueAtOverride` in the event payload (a future TaskWorker enhancement). For the demo, 24h is a reasonable default that matches the MEDIUM SLA — HIGH and CRITICAL tickets will land in the same 24h-offset task and the assignee can self-prioritise from the priority field.

**Verification (live counts on `tenant_demo`):**

```
categories: 3                  tickets_open: 1
subcategories: 11              tickets_in_progress: 1
subcategories_with_default: 1  tickets_resolved: 1
subcategories_with_role: 1     tickets_vendor_assigned: 1
sla_policies: 12               tickets_closed: 1
vendors: 2                     comments: 3
preferred_vendors: 1           comments_internal: 1
tickets: 5                     activity: 8
                               problems: 1
                               problem_tickets: 2
                               auto_task_rules_tkt: 1
                               auto_task_actions_tkt: 1
```

All counts match the plan exactly. Idempotent re-run logs `tkt_categories already populated for demo school — skipping` with no INSERTs. `tenant_test` stays empty (`tkt_categories=0, tkt_tickets=0, tkt_problems=0`) — matches the test-tenant convention from prior seed scripts.

**Plan vs. catalogue reconciliation:** The plan's `IT-001` and `FAC-001` codes both already exist in `packages/database/data/permissions.json` (groups "IT & Technology" and "Facilities & Maintenance" respectively). No catalogue changes were needed. The plan's grant of "IT-001:admin + FAC-001:admin to School Admin/Platform Admin" is already in place via the `everyFunction: ['read','write','admin']` block on those two roles — no explicit row needed in `rolePermsSpec`. Only the Teacher and Staff IT-001 grants are net-new.

**Sample assignee resolution:** `findEmployeeId('principal@demo.campusos.dev')` returns Sarah Mitchell's `hr_employees.id` via the joined query through `platform.iam_person → platform.platform_users → hr_employees`. This mirrors the seed-tasks.ts pattern. Used for IT/Hardware's `default_assignee_id`, the assignee on T1/T2/T3/T5, and the problem's `assigned_to_id`.

**What's deferred to later steps:**

- Step 4 lands TicketService + CategoryService + SlaService + VendorService with ~18 endpoints. The auto-assignment chain (subcategory `default_assignee_id` → `auto_assign_to_role` → unassigned) is implemented in TicketService.create. The service emits `tkt.ticket.{submitted,assigned,resolved}` events — `tkt.ticket.assigned` feeds the Cycle 7 TaskWorker via the auto-task rule seeded in this step.
- Step 5 lands CommentService + ActivityService + ProblemService. The activity log is written by a private `recordActivity()` helper called from every lifecycle path. The seed left 8 activity rows in place for the Step 9 UI to render but the Step 5 service is the canonical writer going forward.
- Step 6 lands TicketNotificationConsumer subscribing to `tkt.ticket.{submitted,assigned,commented,resolved}` and routing to the Cycle 3 NotificationQueueService.

## Step 4 — Ticket NestJS Module — Core CRUD + Lifecycle

**Status:** DONE. New `apps/api/src/tickets/` with 4 services + 4 controllers + 1 DTO module + `TicketsModule`. Wired into `AppModule.imports` after `WorkflowsModule`. **18 endpoints** (5 categories + 2 SLA + 3 vendors + 8 tickets). Build clean, all routes mapped on boot, live smoke verified end-to-end on `tenant_demo`.

**Files:**

- `apps/api/src/tickets/dto/ticket.dto.ts` — DTOs with `class-validator` (CreateTicketDto with priority/category/subcategory/title/description/locationId; AssignTicketDto with `assigneeEmployeeId`; AssignVendorDto with `vendorId` + optional `vendorReference`; ResolveTicketDto with optional resolution note; CancelTicketDto with optional reason; ListTicketsQueryDto with status/priority/category/assignee/vendor/dateRange/includeTerminal filters; full Category / Subcategory / SLA / Vendor CRUD shapes; const arrays for `TICKET_PRIORITIES`, `TICKET_STATUSES`, `VENDOR_TYPES` driving `IsIn` validators).
- `apps/api/src/tickets/category.service.ts` + `category.controller.ts` — 5 endpoints. `GET /ticket-categories` returns the tree with subcategories inlined (single LEFT JOIN to `hr_employees`+`iam_person` for the default-assignee name); admin POST/PATCH on category + subcategory.
- `apps/api/src/tickets/sla.service.ts` + `sla.controller.ts` — 2 endpoints + the static `SlaService.computeSnapshot(input, policyId)` helper used by TicketService at read time. The clock is computed not stored: snapshot returns `responseHoursRemaining` / `resolutionHoursRemaining` (negative = breached) plus boolean `responseBreached` / `resolutionBreached`. Returns nulls when the matching timestamp is already populated (response done once `first_response_at` lands; resolution done once `resolved_at` lands). `upsert()` is admin-only and INSERTs or UPDATEs by `(school, category, priority)` so the matrix can be reshaped without a delete-then-recreate dance.
- `apps/api/src/tickets/vendor.service.ts` + `vendor.controller.ts` — 3 endpoints. `GET /ticket-vendors` sorts `is_preferred DESC, vendor_name ASC` so the Step 8 admin assignment dropdown shows preferred vendors at the top. POST + PATCH admin-only with UNIQUE(school, vendor_name) catch.
- `apps/api/src/tickets/ticket.service.ts` + `ticket.controller.ts` — **the keystone.** 8 endpoints (`GET /tickets` + `GET /tickets/:id` + `POST /tickets` + `PATCH /:id/{assign,assign-vendor,resolve,close,reopen,cancel}`). All 6 lifecycle transitions use `executeInTenantTransaction` with `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the ticket row — the locked-read pattern from Cycles 4–7. Emits `tkt.ticket.{submitted,assigned,resolved}`.
- `apps/api/src/tickets/tickets.module.ts` — wires the 4 services + 4 controllers, imports `TenantModule + IamModule + KafkaModule`.

**Auto-assignment chain at submission time:** `TicketService.create()` resolves the assignee in this order:

1. If `subcategoryId` is set and the subcategory has `default_assignee_id` (a `hr_employees` row), use that.
2. Else if the subcategory has `auto_assign_to_role`, resolve the role via the same lookup the WorkflowEngineService uses for ROLE-typed approvers. The `roleTokenToName()` exported helper from `workflow-engine.service.ts` is reused (`'SCHOOL_ADMIN'` → `'School Admin'`); the resolved `platform_users.id` is then bridged through `iam_person` → `hr_employees` to land an `assignee_id` (FK to `hr_employees(id)` on the ticket). Returns null when the role only resolves to a person without an `hr_employees` row (e.g. the `admin@` Platform Admin persona which is intentionally not bridged per Cycle 4 Step 0) — the ticket lands unassigned with a LOG line.
3. Else leave assignee NULL — the ticket lands in OPEN status and waits for the admin queue.

When auto-assignment lands an internal employee, status flips OPEN → IN_PROGRESS and `first_response_at` is populated (the system acknowledges on the assignee's behalf). Otherwise status=OPEN with `first_response_at` NULL until the first admin / assignee comment lands.

**SLA auto-link at submission:** `SlaService.lookupPolicyId(categoryId, priority)` finds the matching `tkt_sla_policies` row and denormalises its id onto the ticket. Returns null when no policy is configured — admin UI can then suggest configuring one.

**Locked-row state machine transitions** (every PATCH endpoint runs `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the ticket row inside `executeInTenantTransaction`):

| Endpoint                             | Permission     | From states                                                          | To state         | Side effects                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PATCH /:id/assign`                  | `it-001:admin` | OPEN, IN_PROGRESS, VENDOR_ASSIGNED, PENDING_REQUESTER                | IN_PROGRESS      | Sets `assignee_id`, clears vendor fields, sets `first_response_at` if NULL. Emits `tkt.ticket.assigned`. |
| `PATCH /:id/assign-vendor`           | `it-001:admin` | OPEN, IN_PROGRESS, VENDOR_ASSIGNED, PENDING_REQUESTER                | VENDOR_ASSIGNED  | Sets `vendor_id` + `vendor_reference` + `vendor_assigned_at`, clears `assignee_id`. No `tkt.ticket.assigned` emit (auto-task targets internal employees, not vendors). |
| `PATCH /:id/resolve`                 | `it-001:write` | non-terminal                                                         | RESOLVED         | Sets `resolved_at`. Optional resolution note inserted as a public `tkt_ticket_comments` row in same tx. Emits `tkt.ticket.resolved`. |
| `PATCH /:id/close`                   | `it-001:write` | RESOLVED                                                             | CLOSED           | Sets `closed_at`. Requester or admin only.                                                             |
| `PATCH /:id/reopen`                  | `it-001:write` | RESOLVED                                                             | OPEN             | Clears `resolved_at`. Requester or admin only. CLOSED is terminal — admin path only.                  |
| `PATCH /:id/cancel`                  | `it-001:write` | OPEN, IN_PROGRESS, VENDOR_ASSIGNED, PENDING_REQUESTER                | CANCELLED        | Sets `closed_at`, keeps `resolved_at` NULL per `resolved_chk`. Cancelling a RESOLVED ticket is rejected (use close instead). Requester or admin. |

Every transition writes a `tkt_ticket_activity` row via the private `recordActivity()` helper — STATUS_CHANGE / REASSIGNMENT / VENDOR_ASSIGNMENT / COMMENT entries with structured `metadata` JSONB matching the Step 3 seed shape.

**Row scope on GET /tickets:** admin sees all; non-admin sees `requester_id = actor.accountId` OR `assignee_id = actor.employeeId` (when actor has an `hr_employees` row). The two predicate paths exist because the referenced columns are different identity types — `requester_id` is a soft `platform.platform_users.id` ref, `assignee_id` is a DB-enforced FK to `hr_employees.id`. `GET /tickets/:id` short-circuits with 404 (not 403) when neither path matches, matching the don't-leak-existence pattern from prior cycles.

**Permission gating:**

- `it-001:read` — list + read tickets, categories, vendors, SLA matrix.
- `it-001:write` — submit ticket + lifecycle transitions on tickets the caller can act on.
- `it-001:admin` — category / subcategory / SLA / vendor CRUD; ticket assign + assign-vendor.

`fac-001:admin` is reached via the School Admin / Platform Admin `everyFunction` block — same admin tier as `it-001:admin` per the Step 3 seed plan.

**Kafka emits** (3 topics, all wired through `KafkaProducerService.emit(...)` so the ADR-057 envelope wraps every payload with `event_type` / `source_module:'tickets'` / `tenant_id` / fresh `event_id` + `correlation_id`):

- `tkt.ticket.submitted` — fires on every successful POST. Payload: `{ticketId, schoolId, categoryId, subcategoryId, title, priority, status, requesterId, slaPolicyId}`.
- `tkt.ticket.assigned` — fires on POST when auto-assignment landed an internal employee, AND on every successful `PATCH /:id/assign`. Payload includes the assignee's resolved `accountId` + `recipientAccountId` (Sarah's `platform_users.id`, both fields kept for Cycle 7 TaskWorker fallback compatibility), `ticket_title` / `priority` / `resolution_hours` placeholders for the seeded auto-task title-template, plus `sourceRefId: dto.id` so the worker's per-(owner, source_ref_id) Redis dedup catches "different event_id but same logical assignment" if a future endpoint re-emits.
- `tkt.ticket.resolved` — fires on every successful resolve. Payload: `{ticketId, schoolId, title, priority, status, assigneeId, requesterId, resolvedAt}`. Step 6 will subscribe a notification consumer to this topic.

**TaskWorker side-fix:** the existing `pickSourceRefId(payload)` helper in `apps/api/src/tasks/task.worker.ts` had a per-domain candidate list (`assignmentId`, `gradeId`, `requestId`, etc.) that did not include the universal `sourceRefId` field. Cycle 8 emits use that universal name. **Extended the candidate list** to include `sourceRefId` / `source_ref_id` (universal escape hatch) at the top of the list, plus `ticketId` / `ticket_id` for completeness. Verified live: with the fix, the auto-task created from a fresh `tkt.ticket.assigned` event has `source_ref_id` populated to the ticket's id. Without the fix, the auto-task lands with `source_ref_id=NULL` (functionally fine for one-shot creation but breaks the per-(owner, source_ref_id) Redis dedup that Cycle 7 documented).

**Live verification on `tenant_demo` 2026-05-03** (10 scenarios, all pass):

1. **S1** — teacher `GET /ticket-categories` returns 3 cats with subcategories inlined (IT 4 / Facilities 5 / HR Support 2).
2. **S2** — teacher `GET /ticket-vendors` returns Springfield IT Solutions (preferred) first, Lincoln Maintenance Co second.
3. **S3** — teacher `GET /ticket-sla` returns 12 policies grouped by category × priority urgency.
4. **S4 keystone** — teacher (Rivera) `POST /tickets` on IT/Hardware HIGH → response shows `assigneeName: 'Sarah Mitchell'` (auto-assigned via subcategory.default_assignee_id), `status: 'IN_PROGRESS'`, `slaPolicyId` populated, `firstResponseAt` populated, `sla.responseHours: 2`, `sla.resolutionHours: 8`, `sla.responseBreached: false`. **Two ADR-057 envelopes captured live on the wire** — `dev.tkt.ticket.submitted` with `event_type='tkt.ticket.submitted'`, `source_module='tickets'`, full payload; and `dev.tkt.ticket.assigned` with `accountId` + `recipientAccountId` set to Sarah's `platform_users.id`, `ticket_title` + `resolution_hours: 8` + `priority: HIGH` placeholders, `sourceRefId` set to the new ticket's id. Cycle 7 TaskWorker fired within ~3s and created an AUTO/ADMINISTRATIVE task on Sarah's list titled `Resolve ticket: Smoke ticket — Hardware`.
5. **S5** — admin `GET /tickets?includeTerminal=true` returns all 6 tickets (5 seed + 1 smoke) sorted by priority urgency.
6. **S6** — teacher `GET /tickets?includeTerminal=true` returns 4 rows (Rivera is requester on T1 + T3 + T5 + smoke); T2 and T4 (Park's + Hayes's) correctly filtered out.
7. **S7** — admin `PATCH /:id/assign-vendor` with Springfield IT Solutions + `vendorReference='WO-SMOKE-01'` → response shows `status: 'VENDOR_ASSIGNED'`, `assigneeId: null`, `vendorName: 'Springfield IT Solutions'`. The schema-level `tkt_tickets_assignee_or_vendor_chk` mutex is satisfied because we cleared the assignee in the same UPDATE.
8. **S8** — admin `PATCH /:id/resolve` with `resolution: 'Vendor swapped the projector lamp.'` → response shows `status: 'RESOLVED'`, `resolvedAt` populated. The optional resolution note landed as a public `tkt_ticket_comments` row in the same transaction.
9. **S9** — requester (teacher) `PATCH /:id/close` → response shows `status: 'CLOSED'`, `closedAt` populated. Multi-column `resolved_chk` satisfied (CLOSED requires both `resolved_at` and `closed_at` NOT NULL — both already populated by the prior resolve).
10. **S10 — 7 permission denial paths:** student GET /tickets 403 (no `it-001:read`); parent POST /tickets 403 (no `it-001:write`); teacher POST /ticket-categories 403 (no `it-001:admin`); teacher POST /ticket-vendors 403 (admin only); teacher PATCH /:id/assign 403 (admin only); parent GET /tickets/:id 403 (no `it-001:read` at the gate); teacher GET /tickets/:T2_id 404 (row scope — Rivera is neither requester nor assignee on Park's plumbing ticket).

**Iteration issue caught and resolved during smoke:** initial smoke command pasted `IT_CAT` from a `psql -tA -c "SET ...; SELECT ..."` command — the `SET` command tag concatenated to the UUID, breaking the POST. Switched to schema-qualified queries (`SELECT id FROM tenant_demo.tkt_categories WHERE name = 'IT'`) without the leading `SET search_path`. Same iteration trap documented for prior cycles' smoke scripts.

**Smoke residue cleanup:** `DELETE FROM tsk_tasks WHERE title LIKE 'Resolve ticket: Smoke ticket%'` (drops the 2 AUTO tasks the worker created across the two smoke runs); `DELETE FROM tkt_tickets WHERE title LIKE 'Smoke ticket%'` (drops the 2 smoke tickets — CASCADE drops their comments + activity rows automatically). Tenant restored to post-Step-3 seed state. Confirmed via `count(*)` on both tables.

**What's deferred to later steps:**

- Step 5 lands `CommentService` + `ActivityService` + `ProblemService` — extracts `recordActivity()` from inside TicketService into a dedicated injectable so multiple services can call it. Adds `GET /tickets/:id/comments` + `POST /tickets/:id/comments` (with `is_internal` filter for non-staff readers) + `GET /tickets/:id/activity` (read-only timeline) + 6 `/problems` endpoints (list / detail / create / patch / link / resolve-batch).
- Step 6 ships `TicketNotificationConsumer` subscribing to `tkt.ticket.{submitted,assigned,commented,resolved}` — fans out IN_APP notifications via the Cycle 3 NotificationQueueService. The auto-task wiring is **already live** through the `tkt.ticket.assigned` rule seeded in Step 3 plus the `pickSourceRefId` fix from this step.
- Cycle 7 carry-over noted: the worker fix to recognise `sourceRefId` / `ticketId` is a small additive change to `pickSourceRefId` that benefits any future emitter that wants per-(owner, source_ref_id) Redis dedup without adding a per-domain alias to the candidate list.

## Step 5 — Ticket NestJS Module — Comments, Activity, Problems

**Status:** DONE. New `apps/api/src/tickets/activity.service.ts` + `comment.service.ts` + `problem.service.ts` + matching controllers + DTO extensions. Total cycle endpoint count: **27** (18 from Step 4 + 9 new — 1 activity + 2 comments + 6 problems). Build clean on first try, all routes mapped on boot, live smoke verified end-to-end on `tenant_demo`.

**Files:**

- `apps/api/src/tickets/dto/ticket.dto.ts` — extended with comment / activity / problem shapes (`TicketCommentResponseDto`, `CreateCommentDto`, `TicketActivityResponseDto`, `ProblemResponseDto`, `CreateProblemDto`, `UpdateProblemDto`, `LinkTicketsDto`, `ResolveProblemDto`, `ListProblemsQueryDto`, plus `ACTIVITY_TYPES` + `PROBLEM_STATUSES` const arrays). Required `@IsArray()` + `@ArrayMinSize(1)` + `@IsUUID('all', { each: true })` on every `ticketIds` array DTO field — without those decorators the global `forbidNonWhitelisted: true` ValidationPipe drops the property silently. Tripped during smoke and fixed before the second run.
- `apps/api/src/tickets/activity.service.ts` + `activity.controller.ts` — 1 read endpoint `GET /tickets/:id/activity` under `it-001:read` with row-scope guard (admin OR requester OR assignee, else 404 — same don't-leak-existence convention as `TicketService.getById`). The `ActivityService.record(tx, ticketId, actorId, type, metadata)` public method is the canonical writer; Step 4's `TicketService.recordActivity()` private helper now delegates to it so the audit log goes through one path.
- `apps/api/src/tickets/comment.service.ts` + `comment.controller.ts` — 2 endpoints `GET /tickets/:id/comments` + `POST /tickets/:id/comments` under `it-001:read` / `it-001:write`. Visibility model implemented at the service layer (admin sees all; assignee sees all; requester sees `is_internal=false` only; non-participant non-admin → 404). POST runs everything in one `executeInTenantTransaction`: INSERT into `tkt_ticket_comments` → if first staff comment AND `first_response_at` IS NULL bump it to `now()` (stops the SLA response clock; staff = anyone other than the requester) → ActivityService.record(...) for the COMMENT row. Emits `tkt.ticket.commented` outside the tx with `firstResponseBumped` flag so the Step 6 notification consumer can surface a "ticket has been responded to" UX cue. Comments on CLOSED / CANCELLED tickets rejected with 403 (caller must reopen first). Public `writeInTx(tx, ticketId, authorId, body, isInternal)` helper added for ProblemService and any future caller that needs an audit-only comment without the full POST path.
- `apps/api/src/tickets/problem.service.ts` + `problem.controller.ts` — 6 endpoints under `it-001:read` (read paths) + `it-001:admin` (writes). All read + write paths short-circuit non-admins at the service layer with 403 (reads) — service-layer admin gate matches Cycle 6 RefundService precedent. Total read/write/admin gating still works because `it-001:admin` is held only via School Admin / Platform Admin's `everyFunction` block.
  - `GET /problems` — list with linked-ticket ids inline; sorted by status urgency then created_at desc; filters `status` + `categoryId`.
  - `GET /problems/:id` — detail with linked tickets array.
  - `POST /problems` — admin creates; optional `ticketIds` array seeds links at creation; multi-column DB CHECK enforces `assigned_to_id` XOR `vendor_id` (also surfaced at the service layer with a friendlier error).
  - `PATCH /problems/:id` — locks the row FOR UPDATE, updates non-status-RESOLVED fields. **Status RESOLVED is rejected here** with a friendly 400 — the batch ticket-flip is a separate code path on `/resolve`. The schema's multi-column `resolved_chk` would also reject a half-populated RESOLVED PATCH (it requires root_cause + resolution + resolved_at all NOT NULL); we surface the 400 before the constraint fires.
  - `POST /problems/:id/link` — adds more tickets. Validates each ticket id exists, deduplicates against already-linked rows in the same tx so the schema's UNIQUE(problem_id, ticket_id) never fires.
  - `PATCH /problems/:id/resolve` — **the keystone batch-resolve endpoint.** Locks the problem row + every linked ticket whose status is in (`OPEN`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `VENDOR_ASSIGNED`, `PENDING_REQUESTER`) using `FOR UPDATE OF t` inside one tenant transaction. Flips problem to RESOLVED with `root_cause` + `resolution` + optional `workaround` + `resolved_at = now()`. Batch-flips every locked ticket to RESOLVED + `resolved_at = now()` and writes a STATUS_CHANGE activity row per ticket (metadata `{from, to: 'RESOLVED', reason: 'batch resolved via problem ID', problem_id}`). Tickets already in RESOLVED / CLOSED / CANCELLED are skipped (the `WHERE t.status = ANY($2)` filter). Emits one `tkt.ticket.resolved` event per flipped ticket OUTSIDE the tx (so a broker hiccup can't roll back), each with `resolvedViaProblemId` + `sourceRefId` populated. Returns `{problem, ticketsFlipped: string[]}` so the Step 9 admin UI can surface the count.
- `apps/api/src/tickets/tickets.module.ts` — extended providers + controllers + exports lists with the 3 new services.

**Comment visibility model (clarified):**

| Caller             | Sees public | Sees internal |
| ------------------ | :---------: | :-----------: |
| Admin              |     ✅      |      ✅       |
| Assignee on ticket |     ✅      |      ✅       |
| Requester          |     ✅      |      ❌       |
| Non-participant    |  404 — fail-closed without leaking existence    |

`POST` honours `is_internal=true` only when the caller is admin or assignee. Requesters who try to set it are silently demoted to `is_internal=false` (the staff/internal distinction is a staff-side concern; surfacing a 400 to a requester whose comment was still saved would be confusing).

**First-response bump rule:** a comment from anyone other than the requester counts as "the first staff response." When `tkt_tickets.first_response_at IS NULL` and the comment author is the assignee or admin, the same UPDATE that touches `updated_at` also sets `first_response_at = now()`. The activity row carries `metadata.first_response_bump: true` so the audit trail records which comment landed the SLA response stop. Subsequent staff comments do not re-bump (the field is monotonic).

**Live verification on `tenant_demo` 2026-05-03** (12 scenarios, all pass):

1. **A1** — Rivera (T1 requester) GET activity → 1 row (the seed COMMENT). `actorName: 'James Rivera'`.
2. **A2** — Sarah (admin) GET activity for the same ticket → same 1 row.
3. **A3** — Rivera GET T3 activity → 2 rows (STATUS_CHANGE OPEN→RESOLVED + COMMENT).
4. **A4** — David Chen (parent, no `it-001:read`) GET activity → 403 at the gate.
5. **C1** — Rivera GET comments on T1 → 1 (seed public) before any new posts.
6. **C2** — admin posts public comment "I will swing by Room 101 after lunch." → response shows `isInternal: false`, `firstResponseAt` on T1 bumps from NULL to now() (verified in DB).
7. **C3** — admin posts internal comment "ordered a replacement lamp" with `isInternal=true` → response confirms `isInternal: true`. Comment count on T1 = 3.
8. **C5** — Rivera (requester) GET comments → sees 2 (seed + C2 public). C3 internal correctly filtered out.
9. **C6** — admin GET comments → sees all 3.
10. **C7** — Rivera tries to POST with `isInternal: true` → response shows `isInternal: false` (silent demote).
11. **C8** — T1 activity now 4 rows: seed COMMENT, then C2 with `first_response_bump: true`, then C3 with `first_response_bump: false` (already bumped), then C7 with `first_response_bump: false` (requester comment doesn't bump).
12. **C9** — Kafka envelope on `dev.tkt.ticket.commented` captured live with full ADR-057 shape: `event_type='tkt.ticket.commented'`, `source_module='tickets'`, payload `{ticketId, schoolId, commentId, authorId, isInternal:false, firstResponseBumped:true, sourceRefId}`. (The Step 6 notification consumer will key on `firstResponseBumped` to surface a different message to the requester.)
13. **P1** — admin GET /problems → 1 row (the seed) with `ticketIds: 2`.
14. **P2** — teacher GET /problems → 403 (service-layer admin-only).
15. **P3** — admin GET /problems/:id → details with `ticketIds: [T1, T3]` inline.
16. **P4** — admin PATCH status=KNOWN_ERROR with `rootCause` → response shows `status: KNOWN_ERROR, rootCause` populated.
17. **P5** — admin PATCH status=RESOLVED via main endpoint → 400 with the friendly `Use POST /problems/:id/resolve` message.
18. **P6** — admin POST /:id/link with T2 → response shows 3 ticketIds.
19. **P7** — duplicate link of T2 → silent skip; count stays at 3.
20. **P9 keystone** — admin PATCH /:id/resolve with rootCause + resolution + workaround → response shows `problem.status: RESOLVED`, `ticketsFlipped: [T1, T2]` (T3 already RESOLVED so skipped). DB confirms all 3 linked tickets are now RESOLVED with `resolved_at` populated; T1 was OPEN→RESOLVED; T2 was IN_PROGRESS→RESOLVED; T3 was already RESOLVED so left untouched.
21. **P11** — T1 activity now has 5 rows including the new STATUS_CHANGE with `metadata: {from: 'OPEN', to: 'RESOLVED', reason: 'batch resolved via problem 019df018-610e-…', problem_id}`.
22. **P12** — Kafka envelope on `dev.tkt.ticket.resolved` captured live for the second flipped ticket (T2): full ADR-057 shape with `resolvedViaProblemId` + `sourceRefId` + `assigneeId: <Sarah>` + `requesterId: <Park>` populated.
23. **Permission denials** — teacher POST /problems 403; teacher PATCH /:id/resolve 403; teacher GET /tickets/:T2/activity 404 (row scope, T2 is Park's not Rivera's); teacher POST /tickets/:T2/comments 404 (same row scope).

**Iteration issues caught and resolved during smoke:**

- **Missing class-validator decorators on array DTOs.** `LinkTicketsDto.ticketIds` and `CreateProblemDto.ticketIds` shipped without `@IsArray()` + `@IsUUID('all', { each: true })`. The global `ValidationPipe` with `forbidNonWhitelisted: true` then dropped the property silently and the controller saw an empty body, returning `"property ticketIds should not exist"`. Pattern to remember for any future array DTO field. Fix: add the validators and `@ArrayMinSize(1)` where the empty case should error explicitly.
- **API-fully-up wait.** Earlier smoke runs fired `dev-login` while the 11 Kafka consumer subscribes were still in flight — the API responded with empty bodies. Resolved by waiting until the `Nest application successfully started` log line lands (typically ~30s on a cold cache). Same pattern documented in prior cycles.

**Smoke residue cleanup** (live SQL on `tenant_demo`):

- DELETE 3 smoke comments (C2 / C3 / C7) — bodies starting with `Smoke C`.
- DELETE 3 COMMENT activity rows that the bumping wrote (filter on `metadata ? 'first_response_bump'`).
- DELETE 2 STATUS_CHANGE activity rows from the batch resolve (filter on `metadata->>'reason' LIKE '%batch resolved via problem%'`).
- UPDATE T1 → `first_response_at = NULL`, `status = 'OPEN'`, `resolved_at = NULL` (revert the SLA bump + the batch resolve).
- UPDATE T2 → `status = 'IN_PROGRESS'`, `resolved_at = NULL` (revert the batch resolve; the seed had it IN_PROGRESS).
- DELETE the link row for T2 (the smoke linked it to the problem; seed only had T1 + T3).
- UPDATE problem row → back to `status = 'INVESTIGATING'`, root_cause / resolution / workaround / resolved_at all NULL (the seed shape).

Post-cleanup verification: T1 has 1 comment (seed), `first_response_at` is NULL, status=OPEN. Problem is back to INVESTIGATING with no resolved_at. Link table back to 2 rows (T1 + T3, the original seed). Tenant is at the post-Step-3 seed shape.

**What's deferred to later steps:**

- Step 6 lands `TicketNotificationConsumer` subscribing to `tkt.ticket.{submitted,assigned,commented,resolved}` — fans out IN_APP notifications via the Cycle 3 NotificationQueueService. The auto-task wiring is **already live** through the `tkt.ticket.assigned` rule seeded in Step 3 plus the `pickSourceRefId` fix from Step 4. Step 6 also wires a downstream consumer on `tkt.ticket.resolved` to mark linked auto-tasks DONE via the `source_ref_id = ticket_id` match (the field that's been in the payload from Step 4).
- The `tkt_ticket_attachments` table is shipped + tested at the schema layer (Step 2) but no service / endpoint surface yet — Step 7 will add the upload UI when the helpdesk staff surface lands.

---

## Step 6 — Ticket Notification Consumer + Auto-Task Wiring

**Status:** DONE. Two new Kafka consumers wired in: `TicketNotificationConsumer` (in `apps/api/src/notifications/consumers/`) fans out IN_APP notifications via the Cycle 3 NotificationQueueService for the four ticket lifecycle topics; `TicketTaskCompletionConsumer` (in `apps/api/src/tasks/`) closes the auto-task DONE-cascade on `tkt.ticket.resolved`. Build clean on first try, both consumers subscribe successfully on boot, live smoke verified end-to-end on `tenant_demo` with the IN_APP delivery worker confirming the requester + assignee see the notifications in Redis.

**Files:**

- `apps/api/src/notifications/consumers/ticket-notification.consumer.ts` — new consumer subscribed under group `ticket-notification-consumer` to all four topics: `dev.tkt.ticket.submitted`, `dev.tkt.ticket.assigned`, `dev.tkt.ticket.commented`, `dev.tkt.ticket.resolved`. Uses the standard `unwrapEnvelope` + `processWithIdempotency` claim-after-success pattern from `notification-consumer-base.ts` (REVIEW-CYCLE2 BLOCKING 2). Per-event the consumer:
  1. Loads `TicketContext` — denormalised join across `tkt_tickets + tkt_categories + hr_employees + platform.iam_person + platform.platform_users` to surface the assignee's `platform_users.id` (when one exists) without re-querying for each event type.
  2. Routes to one of four `fanOutXxx()` methods.
  3. Calls `NotificationQueueService.enqueue()` once per recipient with `idempotencyKey = '<type>:<eventId>:<recipient>'` so a Kafka redelivery never enqueues twice.

- `apps/api/src/tasks/ticket-task-completion.consumer.ts` — new consumer subscribed under group `ticket-task-completion-consumer` to `dev.tkt.ticket.resolved` only. Per event, runs `UPDATE tsk_tasks SET status='DONE', completed_at=COALESCE(completed_at, now())` with `WHERE source='AUTO' AND source_ref_id=$ticketId AND status NOT IN ('DONE', 'CANCELLED') RETURNING ...` — captures the flipped rows so we can emit one `task.completed` per row outside the tx. The `NOT IN (DONE, CANCELLED)` filter is the schema-side belt-and-braces; a Kafka redelivery lands a no-op since the rows are already DONE. The deliberate choice to live in `apps/api/src/tasks/` rather than alongside the other consumers in `notifications/consumers/`: it's a Tasks-domain side effect (DB write + emit), not a notification fan-out.

- `apps/api/src/notifications/notifications.module.ts` — registers `TicketNotificationConsumer` in the providers list.
- `apps/api/src/tasks/tasks.module.ts` — registers `TicketTaskCompletionConsumer` in the providers list.

**Notification fan-out matrix:**

| Topic                  | Recipient(s)                                                  | Notification type   | Notes |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----- |
| `tkt.ticket.submitted` | Every account with `sch-001:admin` (school admins + Platform Admin) | `ticket.submitted`  | Same `loadSchoolAdminAccounts` lookup as `AbsenceRequestNotificationConsumer`. |
| `tkt.ticket.assigned`  | The assignee — `payload.recipientAccountId` (Step 4 emit pre-resolved) with fallback to the context-loaded `assigneeAccountId`. | `ticket.assigned`   | Vendor assignments deliberately do not emit `tkt.ticket.assigned` (Step 4 design — vendors don't have a Tasks app). |
| `tkt.ticket.commented` (public, requester author) | Assignee + admins (admins only when assignee is null so the comment doesn't dead-letter). | `ticket.commented`  | Excludes the author from the recipient set. |
| `tkt.ticket.commented` (public, staff author) | Requester only.                                                 | `ticket.commented`  | The "first staff response" UX cue — payload includes `first_response_bumped` flag. |
| `tkt.ticket.commented` (internal) | Assignee + other admins (NOT the requester — internal stays staff-side). | `ticket.commented`  | Author always excluded. |
| `tkt.ticket.resolved`  | Requester only.                                                 | `ticket.resolved`   | Skipped when requester == resolver (admin resolving own self-submitted ticket). Payload includes `resolved_at` + `resolved_via_problem_id`. |

The `deep_link` field on every payload is `/helpdesk/<ticketId>` so the Step 7 staff UI can navigate the recipient straight to the detail page from the bell.

**Auto-task DONE-cascade flow (closes the Step 3 + Step 4 loop):**

1. Step 3 seeded a `tkt.ticket.assigned` rule in `tsk_auto_task_rules` — Cycle 7 TaskWorker reaction creates an AUTO/ADMINISTRATIVE task on the assignee's list.
2. Step 4 emits `tkt.ticket.assigned` with `sourceRefId: ticketId` so the worker stores the linkage on `tsk_tasks.source_ref_id` (after the Step 4 worker fix to recognise the universal `sourceRefId` field).
3. **Step 6** subscribes to `tkt.ticket.resolved` and runs the `UPDATE … RETURNING` against the tenant schema. Every flipped task gets a `task.completed` Kafka emit so the Cycle 3 notification pipeline can fan it out (the existing `task.completed` consumer chain handles delivery).

The plan called for "a new auto-task condition on this topic marks the linked task DONE." We chose a dedicated consumer rather than extending the `tsk_auto_task_actions.action_type` enum because the schema's enum is a 3-value CHECK constraint (CREATE_TASK / CREATE_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT / SEND_NOTIFICATION). Adding `MARK_TASK_DONE` would require a tenant migration + worker change. A focused consumer keeps the TaskWorker focused on creation and lets Step 6 ship without touching the Cycle 7 surface — future cycles can generalise into a rule engine if more inverse flows arrive.

**Live verification on `tenant_demo` 2026-05-03** (13 scenarios, all pass):

- **N1** — Teacher Rivera POSTs an IT/Hardware HIGH ticket "Step 6 Smoke — Notification" → response shows `assigneeName: 'Sarah Mitchell'` (auto-assigned via the seeded subcategory.default_assignee_id), `status: IN_PROGRESS`.
- **N2** — `ticket.submitted` queue rows: 2 — `admin@` (Platform Admin) + `principal@` (Sarah Mitchell). Both are correctly fanned out via the `sch-001:admin` lookup.
- **N3** — `ticket.assigned` queue: 1 row to `principal@` (the auto-resolved Sarah). Payload includes the `recipientAccountId` field the Step 4 emit pre-populated.
- **N4** — Sarah POSTs a public comment → response `isInternal: false`. The Step 5 first-response bump on the ticket already happened on the auto-assignment path so this comment is a follow-up, not the first response.
- **N5** — `ticket.commented` queue: 1 row to `teacher@` Rivera (the requester) with `is_internal=false`, `first_response_bumped=false`.
- **N6** — Sarah POSTs an internal comment → `isInternal: true`.
- **N7** — `ticket.commented` queue still has only 1 row routed to teacher@; the internal comment did NOT fan out to the requester. The fan-out matrix correctly routed the internal comment to admin@ Platform Admin (Sarah excluded as the author). Verified via `SELECT count(*) WHERE notification_type='ticket.commented' AND email='teacher@…'` returning 1, plus the second row visible to admin@.
- **N8** — Pre-resolve state: AUTO task on Sarah's list `Resolve ticket: Step 6 Smoke — Notification` status=TODO, `source_ref_id` populated to the smoke ticket id.
- **N10** — Sarah resolves the ticket → status=RESOLVED, resolvedAt populated.
- **N11** — Post-resolve state: AUTO task flipped from TODO → DONE with `completed_at` populated to the same second the ticket resolved at. **Auto-task DONE-cascade verified live.**
- **N12** — `ticket.resolved` queue: 1 row to teacher@ Rivera (the requester) with `payload.ticket_title='Step 6 Smoke — Notification'`.
- **N13** — TicketTaskCompletionConsumer log line captured: `[ticket-task-completion] flipped 1 auto-task(s) DONE for ticket 019df044-…`.
- **IN_APP delivery via Redis ZSET (after the 10s NotificationDeliveryWorker tick):** Rivera's `notif:inapp:<accountId>` ZSET top entry is the `ticket.resolved` notification with full payload; entry below is the `ticket.commented` from N4. Sarah's ZSET top entries are `ticket.assigned` + `ticket.submitted`. **Full pipeline (Kafka → consumer → queue → delivery worker → Redis) verified end-to-end.**
- **Iteration issue caught (test-data only):** initial smoke SQL used column name `recipient_account_id` but the actual column on `msg_notification_queue` is `recipient_id`. Fixed and re-ran. Worth noting for the Step 10 CAT cleanup script.

**Smoke residue cleanup:** drop the AUTO task (already DONE) + the 6 `ticket.*` queue rows + the smoke ticket (CASCADE drops the 2 smoke comments + 4 activity rows). Redis ZSET entries for the 2 smoke notifications also removed via `ZREM`. Tenant restored to post-Step-3 seed state. No new artifacts left behind.

**Total Cycle 8 consumers now: 2 (Step 6).** Total Kafka topics emitted by the cycle: 4 (`tkt.ticket.submitted` / `assigned` / `commented` / `resolved` from Steps 4 + 5) + 1 republish (`task.completed` from the DONE-cascade in Step 6).

**What's deferred to later steps:**

- Step 7 lands the helpdesk staff UI (`/helpdesk/new`, `/helpdesk`, `/helpdesk/:id`) — the deep links the notification payloads point at finally have a destination.
- Step 8 lands the helpdesk admin UI with the SLA dashboard + category/vendor management.
- Step 9 lands the problem management UI (the Step 5 ProblemService is already complete on the API side).
- Step 10 lands the vertical-slice CAT walking the full plan flow end-to-end.
- The notification descriptor map in `apps/web/src/components/notifications/NotificationBell.tsx` will need 4 new entries (one per `ticket.*` notification type) so the bell renders human-readable titles — punted to Step 7 since it ships alongside the helpdesk UI.

## Step 7 — Helpdesk UI — Submit + My Tickets

**Status:** DONE. New `Helpdesk` launchpad tile + 3 routes ship the staff-facing ticket lifecycle on the web. Build clean (one minor fix-up during the first build — `EmptyState` uses `action` not `actions`, `useToast()` returns `{toast}` not `{show}`). All 3 routes register cleanly in the Next.js build output. No API changes required — every new surface sits on the 27 endpoints from Steps 4 + 5.

**Files:**

- `apps/web/src/lib/types.ts` — extended with the full Cycle 8 DTO surface: `TicketPriority` / `TicketStatus` / `VendorType` / `TicketActivityType` / `ProblemStatus` union types; `TicketCategoryDto` + `TicketSubcategoryDto` (the categories endpoint inlines subcategories); `TicketSlaPolicyDto` + `TicketVendorDto`; `TicketSlaSnapshotDto` (computed at read time); `TicketDto` with the SLA snapshot inlined; `TicketCommentDto` + `TicketActivityDto`; payloads (`CreateTicketPayload`, `AssignTicketPayload`, `AssignVendorPayload`, `ResolveTicketPayload`, `CancelTicketPayload`, `CreateTicketCommentPayload`); `ListTicketsArgs` filter shape; `ProblemDto` (used by Step 9's admin surface).
- `apps/web/src/lib/tickets-format.ts` — new helper module mirroring the Cycle 7 `tasks-format.ts` pattern. `TICKET_PRIORITIES` + `TICKET_STATUSES` const arrays; per-enum label maps + pill class maps (LOW gray / MEDIUM sky / HIGH amber / CRITICAL rose); `slaUrgency(sla)` returns a 4-state `green | amber | red | none` (green when both windows healthy; amber when remaining < 25% of the budget; red when either window is breached; none when both windows are closed or no policy is linked); `formatSlaRemaining(sla)` renders "2h left" / "30m left" / "Overdue 4h" / "Overdue 2d"; `isTicketLive(status)` excludes CLOSED + CANCELLED for the badge counter; `formatTicketAge(createdAt)` renders relative timestamps for list rows.
- `apps/web/src/hooks/use-tickets.ts` — 13 React Query hooks: `useTickets(args)` (refetch on focus, 30s staleTime), `useTicket(id)`, `useCreateTicket`, `useAssignTicket(id)` / `useAssignVendor(id)` (admin-only mutations — used in Step 8 admin queue), `useResolveTicket(id)`, `useCloseTicket(id)`, `useReopenTicket(id)`, `useCancelTicket(id)`, `useTicketComments(ticketId)` (15s staleTime — comments refresh during a live conversation), `usePostTicketComment(ticketId)`, `useTicketActivity(ticketId)`, `useTicketCategories()` (5min staleTime — config rarely changes), `useTicketVendors()`, `useTicketSla()`. The shared `invalidateTicket(qc, id)` helper invalidates the matching query keys on every lifecycle mutation **plus the Tasks badge query** — because resolving a ticket flips the linked auto-task to DONE via the Step 6 cascade, so the Tasks badge needs to refresh.
- `apps/web/src/components/shell/icons.tsx` — adds `LifebuoyIcon` (Heroicons-style outline lifebuoy ring with 9 strokes for the 4 quadrants + handles + central frame). Same SVG conventions as the rest of the icons file.
- `apps/web/src/components/shell/apps.tsx` — adds the `'helpdesk'` AppKey + BadgeKey, registers the Helpdesk tile gated on `it-001:read` between Calendar and Compliance with `routePrefix: '/helpdesk'` so any nested route (`/helpdesk/new`, `/helpdesk/:id`) keeps the tile lit. Description copy: "Submit a ticket and track requests."
- `apps/web/src/hooks/use-app-badges.ts` — extends `AppBadges` with `helpdesk: number`. The badge counter calls `useTickets({ includeTerminal: false })` gated on `it-001:read` so personas without the perm don't 403, then filters to `isTicketLive(status)` (not CLOSED + CANCELLED). Server-side row scope at `TicketService.list` already restricts non-admins to their own tickets, so the count matches what the page shows.
- `apps/web/src/components/notifications/NotificationBell.tsx` — adds 4 entries to `describeNotification()` (one per `ticket.*` notification type) so the bell renders human-readable titles + subtitles. `ticket.commented` surfaces "Internal note on …" or "New reply on …" depending on `is_internal`, and shows the SLA-clock-stopped subtitle when `first_response_bumped=true`. `iconFor()` returns `LifebuoyIcon` for any `ticket.*`; `colorFor()` uses teal-100 / teal-700.

**Three new routes:**

- **`/helpdesk`** — My Tickets list. 4 filter chips (Open / In progress / Resolved / All). Each row shows: 8-char ticket id (uppercased) prefix, priority pill, status pill, SLA indicator dot (green/amber/red/none) with `formatSlaRemaining` text when active, title (truncated), then a one-line meta row "Category / Subcategory · Assigned to X (or Vendor: Y, or Unassigned) · Nh ago." Click-through navigates to `/helpdesk/:id`. List is sorted by the API's default ordering (priority urgency then created_at desc). Page size: **7.89 kB / 114 kB First Load JS**.

- **`/helpdesk/new`** — Submit ticket form. Category dropdown (3 top-level cats from `/ticket-categories`); when a category is picked, the subcategory dropdown populates with its subcategories (or hides itself if none). Title field (required, 200 chars). Description textarea (4000 chars). Priority chip group LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL with MEDIUM as default. Submit button disabled until category + title are non-empty. Submit calls `useCreateTicket()` and on success Toasts either "Submitted — auto-assigned to {assignee}" or "Submitted — routed to the helpdesk queue" then navigates to the detail page. Page size: **8.86 kB / 115 kB**.

- **`/helpdesk/[id]`** — Ticket detail. Header card with priority + status + SLA pill strip; description (preserves whitespace); 4-cell metadata grid (Category, Requester, Assigned to, SLA target). Lifecycle action bar conditionally renders:
  - **Mark resolved** (assignee or admin, working state) — calls `useResolveTicket`.
  - **Close ticket** + **Reopen** (requester or admin, RESOLVED state).
  - **Cancel** (requester or admin, working state) with `window.confirm`.
  
  **Comment thread** below: oldest-first list with internal comments rendered amber-tinted (`bg-amber-50 ring-amber-200`) plus an "Internal" badge. Reply form at the bottom for active participants; staff (assignee + admin) get an "Internal note" checkbox; requester sees "Visible to staff and the requester." hint text instead. Reply form hidden when the ticket is in CLOSED or CANCELLED. **Activity timeline** at the bottom — read-only chronological list. The `ActivityMetadata` helper renders STATUS_CHANGE rows as "OPEN → RESOLVED · reason: …", VENDOR_ASSIGNMENT rows as "Assigned to vendor · WO-…", and COMMENT rows as "Internal note · stopped the SLA response clock" or "Public comment". Page size: **9.96 kB / 116 kB**.

**Live verification on `tenant_demo` 2026-05-03** (4 read-path scenarios, no mutations — UI sources data from the existing 27-endpoint surface):

- **UI1** — teacher GET `/tickets?includeTerminal=true&limit=200` → 3 rows visible to Rivera (T1 OPEN + T3 RESOLVED + T5 CLOSED — Rivera is the requester on all three; T2 Park's plumbing and T4 Hayes's hallway light correctly filtered out by row scope).
- **UI2** — teacher GET `/ticket-categories` → 3 categories with subcategories inlined (`Facilities` 5 / `HR Support` 2 / `IT` 4) — feeds the New Ticket form's cascading dropdowns.
- **UI3** — teacher GET `/tickets/:T1/comments` → 1 comment from James Rivera (the seed public comment), `isInternal: false`.
- **UI4** — teacher GET `/tickets/:T1/activity` → 1 row (COMMENT activity by James Rivera).

The full mutation paths (submit + lifecycle transitions + comment post including internal-comment-hidden-from-requester) are already verified live in Steps 4 + 5 + 6 smoke runs against the same 27-endpoint surface. Step 7 is purely additive on the web side — no new API endpoints were needed.

**Full Web build output for the 3 new routes:**

```
├ ○ /helpdesk                           7.89 kB         114 kB
├ ƒ /helpdesk/[id]                      9.96 kB         116 kB
├ ○ /helpdesk/new                       8.86 kB         115 kB
```

`/helpdesk` and `/helpdesk/new` prerender as static; `/helpdesk/[id]` is server-rendered on demand (matches the `/tasks/[id]` and `/staff/[id]` precedent — dynamic route id).

**Iteration issues caught and resolved:**

- **`EmptyState` prop is `action` not `actions`.** The Cycle 7 / 6 / 5 EmptyState calls pass `action={<Link>...</Link>}`; the original `/helpdesk/[id]` first draft used `actions={...}` and TypeScript caught it on the first build. Trivial rename. Worth remembering for future code that lifts an EmptyState from another file by hand rather than auto-completion.
- **`useToast()` returns `{toast}` not `{show}`.** The Cycle 6 / 7 surfaces I cribbed the pattern from also got this wrong locally; the canonical helper signature is `const { toast } = useToast()` followed by `toast(message, variant?)` where variant is `'success' | 'error' | 'info'`. Updated 8 call sites in the detail + new pages.
- **Unused TS bindings.** `isParticipant` was dead code (computed but never referenced); `TicketStatus` was imported but unused. Both removed before the second build.

The third build attempt was clean. Total build time across the 3 attempts: ~30 seconds. The notification descriptor wiring was zero-touch because the Step 6 emit payloads already include `ticket_title`, `priority`, `category_name`, `is_internal`, `first_response_bumped`, and `resolved_via_problem_id` exactly the way the bell descriptor expects them.

**What's deferred to later steps:**

- Step 8 lands the **admin** Helpdesk UI — the queue view (`/helpdesk/admin`), SLA dashboard (`/helpdesk/admin/sla`), category tree editor (`/helpdesk/admin/categories`), and vendor management (`/helpdesk/admin/vendors`). The admin surface uses the same hooks but adds the assign + assign-vendor flows that Step 4 already exposes on the API.
- Step 9 lands the problem management UI — `/helpdesk/admin/problems` list + detail + the create-from-ticket flow. The Step 5 ProblemService is already complete on the API side.
- Step 10 lands the vertical-slice CAT walking the full plan flow end-to-end (submit → auto-assign → SLA clock → comment → vendor → resolve → notification → task complete).
- **Attachment upload UI** is deferred. The schema's `tkt_ticket_attachments` table exists from Step 2 but has no service / endpoint surface yet — Step 7 ships the comment + activity reads but no attachment upload + signed-URL flow. The `tkt_ticket_tags` table is similarly schema-only this cycle.

## Steps 8–10 — Pending

Each step's full detail will be written into this document as it ships, matching the level of detail of the corresponding step writeups in `HANDOFF-CYCLE7.md`. The plan-time scope of each is summarised below:

- **Step 8 — Helpdesk admin UI.** Admin queue, SLA dashboard, category tree editor, vendor management.
- **Step 9 — Problem management UI.** List, detail, link tickets, resolve-batch.
- **Step 10 — Vertical slice CAT.** `docs/cycle8-cat-script.md`. The full plan-time scenario walked end-to-end on `tenant_demo`.

## Operational notes

- **Migration discipline.** Cycle 8 follows the splitter trap rule from Cycles 4–7: no `;` inside any string literal, default expression, COMMENT, or CHECK predicate. Block-comment header (no `--` line comments at file head — the splitter cuts the first statement otherwise). `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` for idempotency.
- **Cycle 7 dependency.** The `tkt.ticket.assigned` auto-task rule seeded in Step 3 depends on the Cycle 7 Task Worker being up. The worker auto-discovers `tsk_auto_task_rules.trigger_event_type` at boot and subscribes to the matching env-prefixed Kafka topic. Adding the new rule at runtime requires a worker restart (documented limitation from Cycle 7 Step 4) — we will run `seed:tickets` then bounce the API in dev. Production deploys naturally restart the worker so this is not an ongoing concern.
- **Permission catalogue.** `IT-001` ("Helpdesk Tickets") and `FAC-001` ("Maintenance Tickets") both exist in `packages/database/data/permissions.json` (the seed has carried them forward from earlier cycles unused). Step 3 grants read+write to Teacher / Staff. School Admin and Platform Admin already hold all three tiers via the `everyFunction` mechanism so no extra rolePermsSpec rows needed for admin paths. Cache rebuild after.
- **No new ADR.** Cycle 8 is implemented entirely under existing ADRs (ADR-001 / ADR-020 soft cross-schema FKs, ADR-010 immutable audit log discipline, ADR-011 sole-writer convention adapted to tickets, ADR-033 M60/M65 boundary).

## Closing pre-conditions for the cycle

When all 10 steps are done, the closing handoff entry will record:

- **Build clean.** `pnpm --filter @campusos/api build` + `pnpm --filter @campusos/web build` + `pnpm format:check` all clean.
- **Tag.** `cycle8-complete` tag on the closeout commit.
- **Post-cycle architecture review.** A new `REVIEW-CYCLE8-CHATGPT.md` mirrors the prior cycle template; Round 1 + Round 2 verdicts inline. `cycle8-approved` tag after the final APPROVED verdict.
- **Wave 1 close.** Cycle 8 completes Wave 1 of the delivery plan. The closing CLAUDE.md update marks Wave 1 as done and the platform as ready for Wave 2 (Student Services — Behaviour, Health, Counselling, Library, Athletics & Clubs).
